Assignment 11

Complete the following steps:

1. Using the nyclfights13 library, open all of the data tables and turn them into a databse. Make sure to include flights, airlines, airports, weather and planes.
2. Create a data frame from a SQL pull from the database that consists only of flights that took off from JFK in May.
3. Create a data frame from a SQL pull from the database that consists only of flights that took off on-time (a delay of less than 10 minutes) from Newark at temperatures of less than 40 degrees F.
4. Create data frame from a SQL pull from the database that consists of planes flown by United.
5. Create a model that tests whether certain plane types (e.g. 737s) are more likely to have arrival delays than other planes. You can include other variables in the model. You'll need to do a pull from more than one table to get the data you need.
