02-Assignment
================

For this assignment, you’ll be working with the `sc_debt.Rds` to predict
earnings levels of college graduates using conditional means. You’ll
need to select the college-level characteristics that you think might be
related to earnings levels. Please complete the following steps:

1.  Calculate the mean of the outcome `md_earn_wne_p6`
2.  Use your mean as a prediction: Create a new variable that consists
    of the mean of the outcome.
3.  Calculate a summary measure of the errors for each observation—the
    difference between your prediction and the outcome.
4.  Calculate the mean of the outcome at levels of a predictor variable.
5.  Use these conditional means as a prediction: for every college, use
    the conditional mean to provide a ‘’best guess’’ as to that
    college’s level of the outcome.  
6.  Calculate a summary measure of the error in your predictions.
7.  Repeat the above process using the tool of conditional means, try to
    find 3-4 combined variables that predict the outcome with better
    (closer to 0) summary measures of error. Report the summary measures
    of error and the variables (as text in your `.Rmd` file).

Submit your assignment as `02-assignment_<yourlastname>.Rmd`, where
`<yourlastname>` is your last name. (By the way, any time you see this:
`<sometext>`, that indicates that you need to substitute something in,
so if I were to submit the above assignment, it would be as:
`02-assignment_doyle.Rmd`)

I expect that the `.Rmd` file you submit will run cleanly, and that
there shouldn’t be any errors. Use LOTS of text to tell me what you are
doing.
