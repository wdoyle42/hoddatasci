Progress Report 3
====================

For this progress report, I need the following in an .Rmd file:

1. Code that accesses a dataset that contains your dependent variable and most of your relevant independent variables. 
1. A univaraiate graphic describing the dependent variable.
1. Results of two different analyses that predict your dependent variable (conditional means, regression, classification, k-means clustering)
1. Two graphics that show the results of your analyses above.
