Our first Kaggle competition!
---------------

Today in class, we'll hold a competition for who can best predict an outcome from the consumer expenditure survey. The variable we're interested in today is `grocery`: the amount spent by the family unit on groceries in that quarter. You can use any variables (except `grocery` itself) to predict this outcome. 

For today, we're going to code in pairs. This means that only one person types anything in. The other person sits back and thinks about what should be done and makes suggestions. We'll switch coding pairs halfway through, so everyone will have a chance. 

Here's the process for our competition:

1. When you have a model, run it and calculate the rmse for the TESTING DATASET. Use `predict(mod,newdata=cex_test)` to do this  Let me know when you have a new rmse. 
2. We'll graph the rmse by group in real time. 

3. Be prepared to summarize your model in two ways: first, what variables are included? Second, what types of families are predicted to spend both high amounts and low amounts on groceries? 

3. The winners will get the greatest prize of all: the respect of their peers.
